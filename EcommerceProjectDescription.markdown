# Creative Low-Budget E-Commerce Website Project

## Overview

This project is a custom, self-owned e-commerce platform designed for your wife's creative products (e.g., crochet, pet portraits, and more). The site will be simple yet visually stunning, with a futuristic design featuring parallax effects, mobile-first responsiveness, and a seamless user experience. It’s built to be low-budget, avoiding expensive services, and will scale as her business grows. Deployment will use fly.io, and the tech stack is optimized for cost, performance, and creativity.

## Requirements

- **Simple Product Pages**: Display products with filters (e.g., "crochet," "pet portrait") for her diverse, creative inventory.
- **Customer Accounts**: Enable sign-up/login via OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **Admin Dashboard**: A secure interface for adding products, with metadata automatically synced to Stripe via webhooks.
- **Payments**: Stripe integration supporting Brazilian Pix and custom webhooks.
- **Low Budget**: No costly services (e.g., Redis); rely on good code practices like pagination.
- **Creative Design**: Futuristic, jaw-dropping UI with parallax effects, built mobile-first.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on fly.io for both backend and database.

## Tech Stack

After evaluating options, this stack balances cost, performance, and suitability for an e-commerce site:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React with Next.js**: Your preferred choice is excellent for e-commerce. Next.js offers server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO and performance, aligns with React’s component-based structure, and supports the App Router for modern development. It’s a top-tier choice in the market.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid, custom, mobile-first styling.
  - **Shadcn UI**: A customizable, beautiful component library built on Tailwind for a polished UX.
- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js with Express**: Lightweight, JavaScript-based, and integrates seamlessly with Next.js. Ideal for a low-budget API setup.
- **Database**: 
  - **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, robust, and free-tier compatible with fly.io hosting.
- **Authentication**: 
  - **NextAuth.js**: Simplifies OAuth integration (Google, Facebook, etc.) within Next.js.
- **Payments**: 
  - **Stripe**: Handles payments (including Brazilian Pix) with Node.js SDK and webhooks.
- **Deployment**: 
  - **fly.io**: Hosts both the app and database, keeping costs low and performance high.

**Why This Stack?**
- **Next.js** is a market leader for e-commerce due to its versatility, SEO benefits, and developer ecosystem. It’s better than plain React for this use case and rivals Stuart.
- **Node.js/Express** keeps the backend lean, avoiding resource-heavy frameworks.
- The combo of **PostgreSQL**, **NextAuth.js**, and **Stripe** ensures a secure, scalable foundation without premium costs.

## Project Architecture

### Frontend
- **Structure**: Molecular (components, pages, hooks) for reusability and maintainability.
- **Pages**:
  - **Home**: Hero section with parallax, featured products.
  - **Product Listing**: Filterable grid/list of products.
  - **Product Detail**: Detailed view with "Add to Cart."
  - **Cart**: Local storage-based (low-cost), with checkout link.
  - **Checkout**: Stripe integration.
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Secure product management area.
- **Design**: Dark theme with neon accents, parallax effects, animations (e.g., product-to-cart transitions), and mobile-first responsiveness.

### Backend
- **API Routes**: 
  - `/products`: CRUD operations.
  - `/users`: Read operations (auth-related).
  - `/orders`: Create/read operations.
  - `/webhooks`: Stripe event handling.
- **Security**: HTTPS, token-based auth, input validation, and rate limiting.

### Database
- **Tables**:
  - `Users`: id, email, name.
  - `Products`: id, name, description, price, images, category/tag.
  - `Orders`: id, user_id, total, status.
  - `Order_Items`: id, order_id, product_id, quantity.
  - `Categories/Tags`: id, name (for filters).
- **ORM**: Prisma for type-safe database access.

### Authentication
- Handled by NextAuth.js, storing user data in PostgreSQL.

### Payments
- Stripe SDK for checkout and Pix support; webhooks update order status.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Initialize Next.js (`npx create-next-app`).
   - Install Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
   - Configure NextAuth.js for OAuth.
   - Build pages and components.

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Create Node.js/Express project.
   - Define API endpoints.
   - Integrate Prisma and Stripe.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Deploy PostgreSQL on fly.io.
   - Define schemas and migrate with Prisma.

4. **Creative Design**:
   - Implement parallax (see snippets below).
   - Style with Tailwind (dark/neon theme).
   - Add animations (e.g., CSS transitions, Framer Motion).

5. **Integration**:
   - Connect frontend to backend API.
   - Test Stripe payment flow and webhooks.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy frontend and backend on fly.io.
   - Set up environment variables (API keys, DB credentials).

## Creative Design Elements

### Parallax Snippets
**CSS-Only Parallax** (for hero section):
```css
.parallax {
  perspective: 1px;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

.parallax__layer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
}

.parallax__layer--base {
  transform: translateZ(0);
}

.parallax__layer--back {
  transform: translateZ(-1px) scale(2);
}
```
```html
<div class="parallax">
  <div class="parallax__layer parallax__layer--back">
    <!-- Background (e.g., neon shapes) -->
  </div>
  <div class="parallax__layer parallax__layer--base">
    <!-- Foreground (e.g., product highlights) -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**Interactive JS Parallax** (for product hover effects):
```javascript
document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  const x = e.clientX / window.innerWidth;
  const y = e.clientY / window.innerHeight;
  document.querySelector('.parallax-element').style.transform = `translate(${x * 20}px, ${y * 20}px)`;
});
```

### Design Tips
- Use Tailwind’s custom colors (e.g., `bg-gray-900`, `text-cyan-400`) for a futuristic vibe.
- Add subtle CSS filters (e.g., `filter: blur(2px)`) on backgrounds.
- Optimize for mobile: Test effects on small screens, reduce heavy animations.

## Best Practices
- **Pagination**: Offset-based for product listings (e.g., `/products?page=1&limit=10`).
- **Performance**: Optimize images, lazy-load off-screen content.
- **Security**: Sanitize inputs, use parameterized queries, enforce HTTPS.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure contrast, keyboard navigation.

## Next Steps
1. Gather design inspiration (e.g., Awwwards.com).
2. Set up project scaffolding (frontend/backend).
3. Implement core features (auth, products, payments).
4. Refine UI with parallax and animations.
5. Test end-to-end (mobile/desktop).
6. Deploy and monitor on fly.io.

This project will deliver a creative, budget-friendly e-commerce site that’s ready to grow with your wife’s business. Let’s make it a success!
